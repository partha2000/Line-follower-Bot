# Line-follower-Bot

# AIM: 
          This project aim at building a  line following bot that follows a line.

# WORKING: 
          This project is made with arduino UNO and demonstrates the the use of IR sensor array.
          The line needs to be on a high contrast background.
          Basically an IR sensor returns 0 for a black coloured surface and 1 for 
          rest of the cases. 
          Therefore we can use this to develop a logic such that our bot follows the black path only.
          IR sensors are very easy for beginners to use as it uses sireal communication and doesnt require any further 
          library to be imported.
          The bot is such designed that it can take turns and steer itself on the path. We can add more precision
          to this project by using PID. PID is a closed feedback loop system.
          But PID has its own set of disadvantages 
          for simple applications. I will add PID in future updates.
          
Hope you like this project.
